# Syncthing for Miyoo Flip

## Installation
 - Copy the contents of this repo into /App/Syncthing on your sd card
 - Start your Miyoo flip and go into the apps section and start Syncthing. It will exit by itself, that is normal, it will remain running in the background
 - You should be able to access syncthing from the ip address of your miyoo flip on port 8384, for example http://192.168.1.23:8384
 - Configure syncthing to your liking and everything should work as normal.

## Notes
 - After you get syncthing working, it does not start automatically on boot, you must run it from the apps menu to start syncing your files each time you boot the miyoo flip.
